Hi! I am a **Development Economist** applying **causal inference** to quantify the impacts of development policies.
I am now an Assistant Professor at [International Economic Development Program](https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/gshs/staff/InternationalEconomicDevelopmentP), Graduate School for Humanities and Social Sciences, [Hiroshima University](https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en).

My research focuses on policies for sustainable development in agriculture and rural areas.
My studies have been published in *World Development*, *Food Policy*, and *Economic Analysis and Policies*.
I regularly conduct household surveys and randomized controlled trials to collect primary data for research.
Field surveys and experiments are indeed my major interest as I appreciate the experiences with local people. 
I also apply causal inference methods to secondary surveys and remote sensing data.
Learning how to cleverly use different data formats is such an intriguing and rewarding journey for me.
